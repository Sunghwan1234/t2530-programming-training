1. Cloning `git` repositories

    To send your changes to github you need to create a local clone.

    To do this, follow [the instructions in the training repository](https://github.com/michael-m-2983/t2530-programming-training/blob/master/README.md).

2. Example walkthrough

    The main purpose of git is to track changes in software. I have used this to create some example modifications to the video game project.

    They are available [here](https://github.com/michael-m-2983/t2530-programming-training/commits/example/?since=2024-09-19&until=2024-09-19).

    Please select one of them and try and understand the changes. Then, apply the same changes (manually) to your own local clone.

3. Git Remotes

    After you have made modifications on your local clone of the repository, it is time to send your code to GitHub.

    To do this, follow these steps:

    1. Create a Personal Access Token for your GitHub account and save it somewhere
    2. Open Git Bash \(or another terminal with the `git` command)
    3. Run `git push`
    4. When it asks you for a username, type in your github username. When it asks for your password, paste the personal access token into the terminal.
    5. Check your git repository.
